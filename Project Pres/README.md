# minflat-beamer

The minflat theme is a Beamer theme in modern flat design, i.e. emphasising a minimal yet functional design, primarily designed for mathematical talks. You can choose between two color schemes. A blue violet and a red purple variant. Corresponding colours used are green for the progress bar (and examples) and orange for alert elements.

Just have a look at the [demo slides][]. Here is a little ap√©ritif:
